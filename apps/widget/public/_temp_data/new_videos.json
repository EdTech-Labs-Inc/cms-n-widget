  "cleaned_transcript": "If the stock market crashes tomorrow, how safe is your money? Most people believe that investing is solely about picking stocks, but smart investing begins with asset allocation. The key is to decide how much of your money goes into equities, debt, and gold. \n\nWhy is this important? Each asset performs differently. Equities have the potential to grow wealth, but they come with higher risks. Debt, on the other hand, provides stable and steady returns. Gold serves as a protective barrier, safeguarding your portfolio during uncertain times.\n\nBy combining these assets appropriately, your money can continue to grow even when the markets experience fluctuations. If you want to both protect your money and grow it over the long term, start by learning your risk profile and adopting the right asset mix.",

  "cleaned_transcript": "If you're 25, should you invest like someone who is 55? No, because your time horizon and risk tolerance are entirely different. When you're young, you have time on your side, which means you can take on more risk and invest more in equities for higher long-term returns. However, if you're nearing retirement, you'll want to protect your capital by shifting more into debt and gold. Your asset allocation should change based on your age, goals, and risk comfort level. Not sure where to start? Begin by determining your risk preference and aligning your investments accordingly.",

  "cleaned_transcript": "Your portfolio might be out of balance without you even realizing it. For example, if your stocks grow faster than expected, that’s great—but now equities could comprise more of your portfolio than you planned, resulting in more risk than you intended. Rebalancing is the way to fix that: you shift money from overgrown assets into others, such as bonds, to bring your portfolio back in line. You aren’t changing your goals; you’re simply keeping your risk and returns in check. Be sure to review your portfolio every six to twelve months, or consider having a professional do it for you.",

  "cleaned_transcript": "I used to think that I should start investing only when I have more money. That's what most people believe. But here's the truth: time is money’s best friend. When you start investing early, even with small amounts, your money begins to earn returns, and then those returns earn returns. That is the magic of compounding. The earlier you start, the more time your money has to grow. For instance, ₹5,000 today can do more in 25 years than ₹20,000 can do 10 years later. So, stop waiting. Start with what you have—even if it’s just ₹1,000 a month. Remember, the best time to start was yesterday; the second-best time is today.",

However, if you start investing early, you give yourself something powerful: time. Time helps smooth out the short-term noise, which means that even if the market drops next month, your long-term plan stays on track.\n\nThink of it like this: when you're investing for 10 to 20 years, today's dip doesn't matter much. Moreover, by investing consistently, you build a strong money habit—one that keeps working even when headlines scream panic. The key isn’t timing the market; it's time in the market. \n\nStart small, stay consistent, and let time do the heavy lifting.",
